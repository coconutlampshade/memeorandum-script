# Memeorandum Script

This script scrapes the 20 most recent headlines from memeorandum.com/river.

## Workflow

1. Run the `memeorandum` script to display the 20 most recent headlines with numbered options
2. User selects which articles they want posts about (e.g., "3, 7, 12")
3. For each selected article, fetch the full article content and generate a ~250 word blog post

## Blog Post Style

Write in the style of Boing Boing - conversational, witty, slightly irreverent, with a sense of wonder or outrage as appropriate. The tone should be:
- Engaging and opinionated
- Accessible to general readers
- Wry humor where appropriate
- Critical thinking about power structures

## Blog Post Format

Each post should:
- Be approximately 250 words
- Credit the original source naturally within the text (e.g., "As reported in the New York Times, ..." or "According to Politico, ...")
- Include a hyperlink to the original article
- Have a catchy headline
- Get to the interesting/important point quickly

## Example Attribution Styles

- "As reported in [The Washington Post](url), ..."
- "According to [Axios](url), ..."
- "[The Guardian reports](url) that ..."
- "Over at [Politico](url), they're reporting ..."

## Avoiding AI-Sounding Writing

To keep posts sounding human, follow these rules:

### Words and Phrases to AVOID
- delve, tapestry, multifaceted, underscore, leverage, embark, navigate, unlock, foster, realm, myriad, plethora, testament, pivotal, encompasses, intricacies
- "marking a pivotal moment in..."
- "representing a significant shift toward..."
- "highlighting the importance of..."
- "underscoring the significance of..."
- "In today's ever-evolving world..."
- "In the realm of..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- "This serves as a reminder that..."
- "At its core..."
- "rich cultural heritage," "vibrant community," "enduring legacy," "cutting-edge," "revolutionary," "unprecedented"

### Structural Rules
- Don't overuse em dashes for artificial drama
- Vary paragraph lengths (some short, some longer)
- Don't always use three examples—two or four is fine
- Avoid "not only X but also Y" constructions
- Don't hedge everything with "it can be argued" or "one might say"
- Skip significance inflation—don't tell readers how important something is, just show them

### What TO Do
- Use concrete, specific details (dates, names, numbers)
- Take actual positions rather than hedging
- Let prose have texture—short sentences, longer ones, fragments
- Trust the reader to understand significance without being told
- State facts directly instead of attributing to vague "experts"

### Sentence Rhythm and Flow
- Avoid too many short, punchy sentences in a row—it becomes exhausting to read
- Mix sentence lengths: follow a short sentence with a longer one that breathes
- Use conjunctions (and, but, so, because) to connect ideas rather than always starting new sentences
- Let some paragraphs unspool a bit—not everything needs to be staccato
- Occasional longer sentences with clauses and asides create a more natural, conversational rhythm
- Read it back: if it sounds like a series of punches, smooth it out
